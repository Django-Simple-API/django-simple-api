# Django Simple API

## About Us
***Django Simple API*** is a non-intrusive component that can help you quickly create APIs.

It's not an API framework, it's just a lightweight Django-based plugin that's very easy to learn and use.

It has two core functions:

* Automatic generation of interface documents
* Automatic validation of request parameters

To help us develop faster, we also extended support for `application/json` requests and provided some useful utility functions.


## Learn and used

⚠️ We support both view-function and class-view at the same time for all functions. If there is no special description in the document, it means that it is applicable to both views. 
Where special support is needed, we will indicate how to do it in the document.
